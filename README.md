### Currently covered (at least started)
1. Chronal Calibration https://adventofcode.com/2018/day/1

### Rules for this one:
1. Use TDD in hardcore way:
    1. Tests first
    1. Code second
    1. Refactor third
2. Make it consistent (e.g. couple hours per week)
3. Experiment with setups are welcome
4. Try to document enlightments and problems
